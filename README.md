# Badger

Badger is a fast and simple CLI-tool used to find unregistered domains using wildcards & characterset combinations.

**Example**
```sh
badger -custom aoe -tld se,io,nu h_ll_ w_rld d_min_ti_n
```


This will perform a whois lookup on domain name combinations using selected top-level domains (`se,io` and `nu`) and combinations of the characters `aoe` in three separate search terms `h_ll_`, `w_rld` and `d_min_ti_n`. Underscore `_` is treated as the wildcard character and is replaced with different combinations of `aoe`.

`h_ll_` contains two wildcard characters, which means badger will combine `aoe` in all possible combinations using 2 character slots.(3 characters in 2 slots can be combined in 3^2 = 9 possible combinations (ex. `halla`, `hallo`, `halle` etc).
